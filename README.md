# Responsive Login Page Template

Created as a part of an exercise to showcase my **HTML & CSS** skills (or weaknesses). With help of media queries there are two layouts at hand:

Mobile layout:

<img alt="login-page-mobile-view" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/971b8f60-14a1-48c0-a7e6-727ff4622471" width="200"/>


Desktop layout:

<img alt="login-page-desktop-view" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b00eeead-0fa2-4a20-954e-2669582571da" width="500"/>

What a pleasant work! ðŸ¤“
